# Gauss_UID_Backend.py
#
# Main processing script for the firida detection pipeline.
# Takes a recording folder (with Camera1-4 subfolders), runs YOLO on each image,
# then tries to figure out where each detected firida actually is in the real world
# using the LiDAR point cloud. Falls back to flat-ground math if LiDAR misses.
#
# Quick note on the Z coordinate issue we spent way too long on:
# The GPS altitude in the coordonate.csv is WGS84 ellipsoidal height (~287m here).
# The LAS files store orthometric height referenced to the Black Sea datum (~247m).
# That's a ~39m gap, which means every single ray was flying 39m above the point cloud.
# We auto-detect this offset at startup by comparing GPS Z to the nearest ground points
# in the LAS file. For this area of Romania it's consistently around 39.1m.
